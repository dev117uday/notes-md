# Which is faster : Maps, slices

## Using slice

```go
package main

import (
    "runtime"
)

type data struct {
    i, j int
}

func main() {
    var N = 40000000
    var structure []data
    for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
        value := int(i)
        structure = append(structure, data{value, value})
    }
    runtime.GC()
    _ = structure[0]
}
```

## Using a map with pointers

```go
package main

import (
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
    var N = 40000000
    myMap := make(map[int]*int)
    for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
        value := int(i)
        myMap[value] = &value
    }
    runtime.GC()
    _ = myMap[0]
}
```

## Using a map without pointers

```go
package main

import (
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
    var N = 40000000
    myMap := make(map[int]int)
    for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
        value := int(i)
        myMap[value] = value
    }
    runtime.GC()
    _ = myMap[0]
}
```

## Splitting the map

The implementation of this subsection will split the map into a map of maps, which is also called **sharding**. The program of this subsection is saved as `mapSplit.go` and will be presented in two parts

```go
package main

import (
    "runtime"
)

func main() {
    var N = 40000000
    split := make([]map[int]int, 200)
    for i := range split {
        split[i] = make(map[int]int)
    }
    for i := 0; i < N; i++ {
        value := int(i)
        split[i%200][value] = value
    }
    runtime.GC()
    _ = split[0][0]
}
```

## Results

What will be important in the presented output is not the exact numbers but the time difference between the four different approaches.

```text
$ time go run main.go 

Using plain slices
