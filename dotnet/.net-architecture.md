# .NET architecture

* a virtual execution system called the common language runtime \(CLR\)
* The CLR is the implementation by Microsoft of the common language infrastructure \(CLI\)
* Source code written in C\# is compiled into an intermediate language \(IL\) that conforms to the CLI specification. The IL code and resources, such as bitmaps and strings, are stored in an assembly, typically with an extension of `.dll`. 
* When the C\# program is executed, the assembly is loaded into the CLR. The CLR performs Just-In-Time \(JIT\) compilation to convert the IL code to native machine instructions. The CLR provides other services related to automatic garbage collection, exception handling, and resource management. Code that's executed by the CLR is sometimes referred to as "managed code," in contrast to "unmanaged code," which is compiled into native machine language that targets a specific platform.
