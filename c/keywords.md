# Keywords

### Modifier Keywords

Modifier keywords are specific keywords that indicate who can modify types and type members. Modifiers allow or prevent certain parts of programs from being modified by other parts.



| Keyword | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| abstract | The `abstract` modifier indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. An abstract class cannot be instantiated |
| async | Use the `async` modifier to specify that a method, [lambda expression](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/lambda-expressions), or [anonymous method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/delegate-operator) is asynchronous |
| const | You use the `const` keyword to declare a constant field or a constant local |
| [event](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-event) | The `event` keyword is used to declare an event in a publisher class. |
| extern | The `extern` modifier is used to declare a method that is implemented externally |
| new modifier | When used as a declaration modifier, the `new` keyword explicitly hides a member that is inherited from a base class. When you hide an inherited member, the derived version of the member replaces the base class version |
| in modifier | [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/in-generic-modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/in-generic-modifier) |
| out | [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-generic-modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/out-generic-modifier) |
| override | The `override` modifier is required to extend or modify the abstract or virtual implementation of an inherited method, property, indexer, or event. |
| [partial](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-partial-class) | It is possible to split the definition of a [class](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/class), a [struct](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/builtin-types/struct), an [interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/interface) or a method over two or more source files. Each source file contains a section of the type or method definition, and all parts are combined when the application is compiled. |
| readonly | A `readonly` field can't be assigned after the constructor exits |
| sealed | When applied to a class, the `sealed` modifier prevents other classes from inheriting from it |
| [static](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-static) | Use the `static` modifier to declare a static member, which belongs to the type itself rather than to a specific object |
| unsafe | The `unsafe` keyword denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operation involving pointers |
| virtual | The `virtual` keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declaration and allow for it to be overridden in a derived class. |
| volatile | The `volatile` keyword indicates that a field might be modified by multiple threads that are executing at the same time. The compiler, the runtime system, and even hardware may rearrange reads and writes to memory locations for performance reasons |
