* Inheritance: the usual
  * types:
    * Single Inheritance: single parent: single child
    * Multilevel Inheritance : single parent -> one child -> child
    * Hierarchical Inheritance : single parent -> multiple child
    * Hybrid Inheritance : combination of one or more inheritance
* Encapsulation: packing up all requirements in one entity and conditions on top of it for appropriate usage.
* Abstraction : hiding the internal details and working
  * abstract class : cannot be instantiated — implementation class will have to override
  * abstract method : cannot be implemented — implementation class will have to override
  * GraphicObject object = new Circle()
  * GraphicObject is the abstract class, Circle is its concrete implementation
* Polymorphism : Interfaces
